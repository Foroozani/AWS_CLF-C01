## What is Cloud Computing?

• Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources

• Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go** pricing 

• You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need

• You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly** 

• Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services


Amazon Web Services (AWS) owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via web application.

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
* On-demand self service:

   * Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
   
* Broad network access: 

   * Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
   
* Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:

   * Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
   
   * Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
   
* Rapid elasticity and scalability: 

   * Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed 
   
   * Quickly and easily scale based on demand
   
* Measured service: 

   * Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
